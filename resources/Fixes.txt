Bug Fixes
1.  Capability of importing multiple files at the same time. (through file chooser)
2.  Fix the coloring of the lines.  Sometimes it will all have the same colors. (High priority) (legend displays correct color, not drawn correctly)
3.  Be capable of importing files from the two types of network analyzers that we have.  I will send some samples. (new file structure)
4.  When opening the software, errors come up if the software cannot find the files. (delete not found files, no need notification)

New Features
1. Vertical benchmark line on graph (w/ y value displayed on bottom of graph)
2. Export screenshot of graph w/ labels as bitmap

Goals
1. Distribute as consumer software
